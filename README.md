# Regular Expressions for RxJS

RxJS implementation of [Regular Expressions for Reactive Streams](https://github.com/expressions-for-reactive-streams/spec-regular-expressions)

```
npm i exprs-rx
```

## Intro

This library allows us to apply RegExp-like syntax to Observables, in order to select events from them.

Imagine that we have three streams:

```
A  ----o---------------
B  -o-o--o--o--o---o-o-
C  --------------o-----
```

And we want to select only those emissions that happen after A and before C emits

```
A  ----o---------------
B  -.-.--o--o--o---.-.-
C  --------------o-----
```

We can do that by applying a following expression:

```
AB*C
```

This expression means:

> Take one emission from `A`
> Then take all emissions from `B`
> Until `C` emits. Take that one emission from `C` too
> Then complete

## Use

Query `mousemove` events after `mousedown` and before `mouseup`

```js
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs'; 
import { repeat } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { exec } from 'exprs-rx';

const A = fromEvent(item, 'mousedown');
const B = fromEvent(document, 'mousemove');
const C = fromEvent(document, 'mouseup');

exec('AB*C', { A, B, C })
    .pipe(
        repeat() // repeat the cycle
    )
    .subscribe(console.log);
```

Try this example:

## Notes

Currently, the library supports `A` â€” capital letters that represent a single emission of a corresponding stream.

And a repeat `A*` notation that will consume multiple events from the corresponding stream, until completion or until next entry in the regex matches.
