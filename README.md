# Regular Expressions for reactive streams in RxJS

RxJS implementation of [Regular Expressions for Reactive Streams](../spec-regular-expressions)

## Install

```
npm i exprs-rx
```

## Use

```js
import { exec } from 'exprs-rx';

// const A = ...
// const B = ...
// const C = ...

exec('AB*C', { A, B, C })
    .pipe(
        // ...
    )
    .subscribe(console.log);
```

Currently, the library supports `A` â€” capital letters that represent a single emission of a corresponding stream.

And a repeat `A*` notation that will consume multiple events from the corresponding stream, until completion or until next entry in the regex matches.

For regex specification and plans on vocabulary, please, see this repo https://github.com/expressions-for-reactive-streams/spec-regular-expressions
